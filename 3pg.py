# So I'm going to start out by using Allison's implementation of a tree struct for the sake of visualization. 
# In the future, though, I'll integrate this with my own tree_class. I jsut don't know how different they will
# be yet, and whether or not it would be efficient to have them as the same class.

class TreeViz:
    def __init__(self, x, z, dbh_dev, height_dev, draw) -> None:
        self.position = (x, z)          # X and Z coordinates of the spawn point (?) of the tree
        self.dbh_dev = dbh_dev          # Diameter of breast height
        self.height_dev = height_dev    # height of the tree
        self.draw = draw                # Bool -- either draw or don't draw the tree
