A brainstorm summary of Allison Thompson's thesis on 3-PG in C++

Stand input parameters:
- initial wf
- initial wr
- initial ws
- time (months since the beginning of the simulation. Do I need this?)
- start age (age of trees in years at beginning of simulation)
- start month (month in which the simulation began. 1-12)
- start year 
- initial dbh (initial diameter at breast height, used for initial calculations)
- fertility rating (between 0, very limiting, and 1, not limiting)

Site input parameters:
- monthly mean daily max temperature
- monthly mean daily min temperature
- monthly rainfall
- monthly mean daily solar radiation
- monthly frost days
- soil water (available soil water)
- max soil water

Species input parameters:
- lec       (light extinction coefficient)
- p2        (diamter at breast height at 2cm, used in partitioning ratios)
- p20       (diameter at breast height at 20cm, used in partitioning ratios)
- acx       (species specific max potential canopy quantum efficiency)
- sla_1     (SLA in older stands)
- sla_0     (SLA in younger stands)
- fn0       (value of FN when FR = 0)
- nfn       (power of (1-FR) in FN)
- tc        (age when canopy closes)
- max age   (max age stand, used in age mod)
- r age     (relative age to give fage=0.5)
- mf        (mean fractions of biomass per tree that is lost when a tree dies-- foliage)
- mr        (mean fractions of biomass per tree that is lost when a tree dies-- root)
- ms        (mean fractions of biomass per tree that is lost when a tree dies-- stem)
- yfx       (maximum litterfall rate per month)
- yf0       (minimum litterfall rate per month)
- tyf       (age when litterfall rate has median value)
- yr        (average monthly root turnover rate (1/month))
- nr_min    (minimum root partitioning ratio)
- nr_max    (maximum root partitioning ratio)
- m_0       (m on sites of poor fertility, eg. FR=0)
- wsx1000   (value of wsx when n=1000)
- nm        (exponent of self thinning rule)

What is....
